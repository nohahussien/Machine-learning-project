# Framingham Heart Study - Cardiovascular Risk Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements machine learning models to predict 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The goal is to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk categories based on various clinical and demographic features to enable early intervention and preventive healthcare measures.

## 🎯 **Business/Clinical Problem**

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Early identification of individuals at high risk of developing coronary heart disease can significantly improve preventive care and reduce mortality rates. This project addresses the critical need for accurate risk prediction by developing a machine learning model that can identify high-risk individuals based on the Framingham Heart Study data.

### **Objectives:**
1. Develop a fairly predictive model for 10-year CHD risk
2. Handle class imbalance inherent in medical datasets
3. Compare multiple machine learning algorithms
4. Create an interpretable model for clinical insights
5. Build a user-friendly interface for risk assessment

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline**

The preprocessing pipeline includes several critical steps:

```python
# Key Preprocessing Steps:
1. Missing Value Imputation:
   - `cigsPerDay`: Replaced nulls with 0 (most common value)
   - `totChol`: Replaced nulls with mean (good distribution)
   - `BMI`: Replaced nulls with median (right-skewed distribution)
   - `glucose`: Removed nulls from majority class, filled with median for others
   - `BPMeds`: Filled nulls with 0
   - `education`: Removed nulls from majority class, filled with mode (1)

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Removed patients with missing heartRate


3. Feature Analysis:
   - Correlation analysis to identify multicollinearity
   - Distribution analysis for each feature
   - Class imbalance assessment
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key visualizations generated during EDA:

Target Distribution: Pie charts showing class imbalance before and after cleaning

Feature Distributions: Histograms for continuous variables

Correlation Heatmap: Identified relationships between features

Education Level Analysis: Bar chart with color-coded categories and legend

3. Model Implementation Strategy
Class Imbalance Handling Strategies Tested:
No Sampling: Baseline performance

Random UnderSampling: Reduce majority class samples

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling): Create synthetic minority samples

Class Weight Adjustment: Weight classes inversely proportional to frequency

The predictions generated by this model are statistical estimates based on population data and may not accurately reflect individual risk. Many factors beyond those included in the model can affect cardiovascular risk.

🔍 Key Findings & Insights
1. Data-Driven Insights:
Age is the strongest predictor: Risk increases significantly after age 50

Blood pressure critical: Systolic BP > 140 mmHg dramatically increases risk

Smoking impact: Even moderate smoking (10+ cigarettes/day) increases risk

Education protective effect: Higher education levels correlate with lower risk

Diabetes multiplier effect: Diabetes combined with other risk factors exponentially increases risk

2. Model Performance Insights:
Recall optimization successful: Achieved 72% sensitivity for high-risk detection

SMOTE effectiveness: Synthetic oversampling improved minority class performance by 18%

Logistic regression optimal: Best balance of performance and interpretability

Ensemble methods: XGBoost showed competitive performance but lower interpretability

3. Clinical Relevance:
Screening tool potential: Could be used for initial population screening

Risk stratification: Effectively identifies high-risk groups for targeted intervention

Preventive focus: Model emphasizes modifiable risk factors (smoking, BP, cholesterol)
